listings 
  - with no manufacturer
  - with partial product model

limitations
  - cannot assume product model matching a substring of listing model is same product or vice versa(?)


product: HB-900D

partial matches:
900D
HB900Dx
HB 900

how to determine which partial matches are correct?

  - can store partial matches and compare with confident matches
